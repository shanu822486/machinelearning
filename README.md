Types of ML-
1- Unsupervised Learning
2- Supervised Learning
3- semi-supervised Learning
4- Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning- Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

List of Common Algorithms-

a)Nearest Neighbor
b)Naive Bayes
c)Decision Trees
d)Linear Regression
e)Support Vector Machines (SVM)
f)Neural Networks

Unsupervised Learning-Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.
